Use the pre-configured profiles to obtain gear sets for those DoH classes and level ranges.

If you need a custom set of gear, please modify the pre-configured profiles or modify the "[O] Disciples of Hand Leveling Gear" profile to suit your needs.

NOTE: Please run these profiles on a high level job - preferrably a DoM/DoW job - so you do not die while traveling.
